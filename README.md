Hello Tesla Team, I hope you all are doing good!

Here I have done with coding challenge, I hope you like it and there are some information regarding the project and how to run the test.

TechStack:
* Cypress
* Typescript programming language

Project Architecture:
* e2e Folder -> This folder contains all spec files
* fixtures -> This folder contails all test data and files which require for the tests
* TsConfig file -> To support typescript 
* Cypress.config.ts -> All cypress configuration goes under this config file
* Packet.json -> Dependency management

To Execute the coding:
* Install npm dependencies using `npm i` or `npm install`
* To run the test headless mode use `npm test` command
* To see the test visually with cypress test run use `npm run open` 
    -> Configure E2E testing
    -> Select the browser and click start E2E test
    -> Wait for the browser to launch and click any spec file
